Sean Gilliland

You can call me Sean.

I have never touched Android Studio or any mobile development for that matter. I have been mostly focused on backend and wep development/apps with a strong interest in the JavaScript environment. I also have an interest is learning C++ and getting a little bit closer to the hardware. I would love to combine my passions for photography and computer science by developing apps and tools for photographers. Adobe and/or Nikon are on my list of companies I'd like to work for and maybe even local companies like Filmborn or Moment who focus on mobile device photography, even though mobile development isn't my first choice.

I've done this backup plan a bunch of times so far and its valid, But in all reality, I keep things backed up, I use version control, and I have resources to tap into should my main computer fail me. My bigger concern is juggling 3 classes and 50ish hours of work at my day job. I managed to pull through last quarter with decent grades, but it is always in the back of my mind. It could become a bit too much at any point due to reasons within and beyond my control. We'll see what happens!
